You can create and use your own localizations, for this:
1. Copy one of the [files](/docs/localizations/)
2. Rename it, preferably as in [game](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Language)
3. You can now modify any messages within this file

::: tip Example
I want to translate the plugin into Belarusian
1. Copying the file `en_en.yml`
2. Renaming it to `be_by.yml`
   ![locale](/locale.png)
3. Done!
